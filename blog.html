<h3><a href="#">Five Thoughts on Elitism in Book Ratings</a></h3>
<h6>Written by <i>The Best Books Admin</i> on August 31, 2014.</h6>

<p>If you've ever browsed a list of book ratings -- and if you are reading this site, I think it's fair to assume you have -- you've probably been annoyed that <em>recent</em> or otherwise <em>populous</em> books read by the hoi polloi so often rise to the top. You want them to be lower so that your books get their fair share of the limelight. But how? </p>

<p>The post will offer a few thoughts on this issue. </p>

<p>1) Consider that you might be mildly elitist. I did, and it was a harrowing experience, but I came out of it alive. </p>

<p>2) Now, there may not be anything particularly &quot;wrong&quot; with elitism in this context. That is, from some perspectives, it's reasonable that if someone has read more books, or a wider breadth of books, that their rating should be worth slightly more. </p>

<p>3) Where this breaks down is that everybody kind of recognizes #2, so an <em>arms race</em> among critics begins, where books are rated highly for a wide variety of reasons aside from what we would strictly call their quality. For example, books that are slightly more inaccessible will begin to be rated slightly more highly. </p>

<p>4) Suddenly if you're a critic, your incentive is not to care about the quality of the book anymore, but rather a) (more idealistically) to develop your own unique &quot;taste&quot; to distinguish yourself from other reviews, and b) (more cynically) to consider book rating a sort of beauty contest where all that matters is rating a book highly <em>before</em> other critics do so. You want to champion the next <i>Stoner</i> when it's still lame, so that you can point back to this sponsorship later and have the world recognize your true artistic taste. </p>

<p>5) All of this makes it way harder to know whether a rating corresponds to what somebody actually thinks, or what they want you to think they think, or what they hope that others will one day begin to think. The simplest way to deal with problems #3 and #4 is with massive sample size, and to hope that, as a result of the Law of Large Numbers, these statistical fluctuations will even out, allowing only the true quality of a book to remain. This is why, here at The Best Books, we try to find the largest sample sizes imaginable, and integrate the data into a compressed format for your tabular browsing pleasure.</p>
